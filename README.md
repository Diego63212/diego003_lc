# Modpack

## Content

<p>
Multiple content mods that don't make the game much more complex or harder. Included mods are mostly new moons and a few monsters that are actually interesting to face and don't just kill you.
</p>

## Utilities
<p>
New options and menu so configuration is easier, some mods can be configurated ingame.
</p>

## Rework
<p>
Some changes to how to game works from QoL to monster changes.
